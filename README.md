# Human_feature_extraction
Human motion data can be used for extracting valuable information for example user identification,emotion recognition etc. The inherent characteristics embedded in human-generated motion data offer a unique opportunity to understand and analyze user behavior on a deeper level. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to extract, identify, and verify motions in order to achieve two primary objectives: User identification and Emotion recognition. The main objectives of this project are: 

A) User Identification: In this project we will try to implement a user identification system using Machine Learning. Every individual has their own pattern of motion and this system should be able to identify these patterns, using these patterns the system should identify the users. The system tries to identify the user without having information about their faces. 

B)Human Emotion Detection using Body Motions: Based on the movements provided by the users the system should be able to recognize the emotions like sad, happy, angry etc. Similarly to the first objective, it tries to classify emotions without information of face. The project has a huge significance as it has potential applications in the field of security, mental health and human computer interaction.
