## About the Project

>Welcome to the Human Skin Disease Detection and Information Database project. This repository hosts a dataset for skin disease images, machine learning models for disease detection, and an information platform for skin disease education.
>The project uses a diverse collection of real-world skin disease images from DermNet. This dataset includes both common and rare skin conditions, making it an invaluable resource for training our detection models.
>This project aims to address the challenges of skin disease diagnosis and patient education. It provides resources for both healthcare professionals and patients:

### Dataset (DermNet Dataset)

The DermNet dataset is a fundamental component of this project, providing a diverse collection of high-quality images related to skin diseases. Here's an overview of the dataset:

- The DermNet dataset encompasses a wide range of skin conditions, including common dermatological issues, as well as rare and uncommon diseases. This diversity is instrumental in training and evaluating machine learning models to handle various clinical scenarios.

- The images included in the dataset are sourced from real-world clinical cases, ensuring that they are highly relevant to practical applications in dermatology and healthcare. They reflect the complexity and variability encountered in clinical practice.

- Ethical considerations have been a priority in curating the DermNet dataset. Patients' informed consent has been obtained for the inclusion of their medical images, aligning with ethical standards in research involving medical data.

- The DermNet dataset is continually updated and expanded to include new images and conditions. This dynamic nature ensures that it remains a current and valuable resource for research and clinical applications.

- While the dataset is extensive and rich, it also presents challenges related to class imbalance, label accuracy, and data augmentation for rare conditions. Addressing these challenges is an integral part of our research efforts.

- You can access the DermNet dataset for research purposes by downloading it from [https://dermnetnz.org/image-library].

By leveraging the DermNet dataset, this project aims to advance the field of dermatology, improve skin disease diagnosis, and empower individuals with accurate information about various skin conditions.
