## About the Project

This project aims to address the challenges of skin disease diagnosis and patient education. It provides resources for both healthcare professionals and patients:

### Dataset

Our dataset contains a diverse collection of skin disease images, including both common and uncommon conditions. It serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating machine learning models for disease detection.

### Machine Learning Models

We have developed machine learning models capable of accurately identifying skin diseases from images. These models can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosis and can be integrated into healthcare systems.

### Information Platform

Our information platform is designed to provide patients and caregivers with comprehensive information about various skin diseases. It includes details on symptoms, diagnostic procedures, treatment options, and preventive measures. This platform empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their health.
